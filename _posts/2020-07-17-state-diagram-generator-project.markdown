description: "This is a web application that takes regular expressions as Inputs and creates corresponding Finite Automata - both Deterministic (DFA) and Non-Deterministic (NFA) as an output. Correspondingly also outputs the transition state diagram for the Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFA)."

# State Diagram Generator

See project on [GitHub :octocat:](https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/state-diagram-generator) and deployed 
[here üåê](state-diagram-generator.web.app/).

This project has been created to display the deterministic finite state automata (DFA) or the Non-Deterministic Finite 
State Automata (NFA) of any given valid regular expression.

A deterministic automata along with it's transmission table will be generated for the given regular expression and the 
user can also check whether any given string is recognized by that particular regular language.
