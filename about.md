    A potterhead and greek mythology enthusiast who mainly programs in Java and has recently ventured out 
    into Python. Is trying out ML to see what all the fuss is about and he might actually ❤ it. He is 
    actively getting his hands dirty with a few courses on Coursera. His full catalog of Coursera courses
    can be seen

    Likes solving problems on hackerrank. He has tried for many years now to solve all the domains on 
    hackerrank, but so far he has only been able to solve Java and Python and chunks of the Algorithms & 
    Data Structures section. If you wish to have mercy on him then please contribute 
    <a href="https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/hackerrank-data-structures">here</a> & 
    <a href="https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/hackerrank-algorithms">here</a> 🙏.

    Currently an undergrad@DTU batch of '21 studying mathematics and computing engineering and teaching 
    java and python to students at What After College. He really enjoys his time spent with the programming
    community and learning from all of them. Tricky questions from students and participants in workshop
    are also welcome, especially when he knows the answer 😏😉
