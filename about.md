    A potterhead and greek mythology enthusiast who mainly programs in Java and has recently ventured out 
    into Python. Is trying out ML to see what all the fuss is about and he might actually ❤ it. He is 
    actively getting his hands dirty with a few courses on Coursera. His full catalog of Coursera courses
    can be seen

    Likes solving problems on hackerrank. He has tried for many years now to solve all the domains on 
    hackerrank, but so far he has only been able to solve Java and Python and chunks of the Algorithms & 
    Data Structures section. If you wish to have mercy on him then please contribute 
    <a href="https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/hackerrank-data-structures">here</a> & 
    <a href="https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/hackerrank-algorithms">here</a> 🙏.

    Currently an undergrad@DTU batch of '21 studying mathematics and computing engineering and teaching 
    java and python to students at What After College. He really enjoys his time spent with the programming
    community and learning from all of them. Tricky questions from students and participants in workshop
    are also welcome, especially when he knows the answer 😏😉

    <b>Funny story</b>: His  engineering degree was for 4 years and was supposed to graduate in 2020, but he
    received an offer to work at CERN, Geneva for an entire year 🎉🥳 and he had to fight the university
    and the administration (basically a lot of begging) to let him go. he eventually won the battle and 
    took a year off from college working at CERN as a full-stack software developer.
</p>

    His sabbatical year luckily also guaranteed that he didn't receive his gradation online due to the 
    COVID-19 pandemic and should probably result in a proper graduation ceremony in 2021. Fingers crossed 
    🤞🤞.

    Fun Anecdote: Till date he has not been able to use the attendance app as he has broken the entire university
    infrastructure with his sabbatical year.
